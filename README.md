# Word Search Puzzle Game

## Project Description
The **Word Search Puzzle Game** is a fun and interactive program where players search for hidden words in a 2D grid of letters. Words can be hidden in any direction—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal—adding an engaging challenge for players of all ages. The game not only allows users to search for words but also saves the puzzle grid and the list of found words to a file, making it easy to review or share progress.
